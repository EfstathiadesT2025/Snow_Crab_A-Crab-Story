# A Crab Story

Information and insights on the abundance of snow crab in the Alaskan Eastern Bering Sea, the geographical distribution
and changes over the years (1975 - 2028) may be useful to monitor for goverment and environmental organizations.

# Objective

First of all, the task of this project was to find an appropriate data set to further apply linear regression, cluster analysis and time series analysis.
Therefore, I came up with an open data set from ‘kaggle’: Snow Crab Geospatial Data (1975-2018).
Gained insights may be useful to monitor for goverment and environmental organizations.

# Data Set

The data was collected from NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce).
It contains catch per unit effort data of commercial snow crab landings in the Alaskan Eastern Bering Sea.
The catch per unit effort is an indirect measure of the abundance of a target species.
